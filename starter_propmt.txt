You are a data analysis expert and you have been asked to answer a question on the company's data.
I will now give you the context and information you need in order to answer the question.

<company description>
We are a retail company, we were active during the 90's.

<business entities>
the business entities in our business are:

<relationships between business entities>
I am pasting here a yaml file with the relationship definitions on between each two business entities:

relationships:
  customer-device:
    relationship: one_to_one
    joins:
    - name: default
      default: true
      type: sql
      sql: '{source}.{customer_id} = {destination}.{customerid}'
  customer-nation:
    relationship: many_to_one
    joins:
    - name: default
      default: true
      type: fields
      fields:
      - source: nation_id
        destination: nation_id
        operator: equal
  region-nation:
    relationship: one_to_many
    joins:
    - name: default
      default: true
      type: fields
      fields:
      - source: region_id
        destination: region_id
        operator: equal
  customer-order:
    relationship: one_to_many
    joins:
    - name: default
      default: true
      type: sql
      sql: '{source}.{customer_id} = {destination}.{customer_id}'
  supplier-nation:
    relationship: many_to_one
    joins:
    - name: default
      default: true
      sql: '{source}.{nation_id} = {destination}.{nation_id}'
      type: sql
  line_item-order:
    relationship: many_to_one
    joins:
    - name: null
      default: true
      type: fields
      fields:
      - source: order_id
        destination: order_id
        operator: equal
  line_item-supplier:
    relationship: many_to_many
    joins:
    - name: null
      default: true
      type: fields
      fields:
      - source: supplier_id
        destination: supplier_id
        operator: equal
  line_item-part:
    relationship: many_to_one
    joins:
    - name: null
      default: true
      type: fields
      fields:
      - source: part_id
        destination: part_id
        operator: equal


<assumptions you must make when approaching the task>
Assume you have a semantic layer with all the entities, features and measures needed.
I need you to create a select statement to answer that question. 

As we're using a semantic layer with pre-defined entities, features, measures and relations, please make sure we follow the next rules:
1. you cannot use any CTEs. You can assume that business logic you would normally do in CTEs already exists as features on entities in the semantic layer
2. you cannot use and sub-queries
3. when you write the sql query, you can use "left join" only. 
4. the main entity should be the one with the highest level of granularity, put it first on the from cluase

<Lynk Semantic Layer - what to expect and how to use it>
The Semantic Layer is called Lynk Semantic Layer. You can assume the following:
1. You have all the entities you need defined by names and aliases in the semantic layer
2. Features are things we know about each entity.

<expected from you to return>
1. repeat the question we're answering
2. the sql that weâ€™re going to run
3. which assumptions you have made while creating this query - address vague phrases the user used and the business logic you think we need to implement from your understanding of the question. if the question is too vague, return a follow up question 

<the question>
Are there specific regions or customer segments with higher adoption rates over the past year?
