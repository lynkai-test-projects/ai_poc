we do not use any tool here ATM.
- we still need to take care of time_agg


refine_prompt:
need tools:
- check that we have all the entities - if not, ask the user to choose an alternative (existing) entity to the missing ones
- check that the highest resolution entity is first (by querying the tool for entity cardinality) - if needed, switch the join order
- check that we have all the join paths between each two entities - if not, ask the user to go and build the missing join path first
- check if there is a joined entity that has more than one join path defined to the main entity - if yes, choose the right one and show that to the user on the final answer
- check that we have all the features - if not, ask the user to choose an alternative (existing) feature to the missing ones, or ask them to go and build the missing feature first
does not need a tool:
- make sure we are using the time agg correctly (how?)
- make sure again that we do not have any CTEs or nested queries
- change "left join" / "outer join" and other types of join to just "join"
- strip out all the "on" statements, unless there are multiple join paths and then we need to use the correct join path name
- in the from clause, replace the reference to assets with references to entities using entity('entity_name')

on the next version, we should create an agent that suggests
1. features
2. new join paths (in case there is no join path betweem a joined entity and the main entity) 



-- consider adding this, maybe not "before you start", but after you return the answer
<before you start>
if the question is too vague, return a follow up question and ask for clarifications

-- on prompt 2, ask lynk tool for all the features on each of the entities we found we need. 
and for each feature check if it might be relevant for the question and we might want to use it. 
gather all these features and then ask yourself if changes and adjustments need to be done to the query, beyond replacing feature names
